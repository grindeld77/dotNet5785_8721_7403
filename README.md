> **A high-performance simulation and dispatcher system for emergency services.**
> Built with **C# & WPF**, focusing on real-time data processing, multithreading, and clean architecture.

---

## 📌 Overview
This system is designed to manage the full lifecycle of emergency calls and volunteer dispatching for Magen David Adom (MDA). Unlike standard management apps, it features a **custom simulation engine** that mimics real-world time progression, creating dynamic scenarios where calls expire, volunteers move, and risk levels escalate automatically.

### 🔥 Key Highlights
* **Real-Time Simulation:** A background thread engine controls the system clock, updating call urgencies and statuses live.
* **Smart UI Visualization:** Uses advanced WPF `Converters` and `DataTriggers` to change interface colors dynamically based on call risk levels (Green 🟢 -> Red 🔴).
* **MVVM Architecture:** Strict separation between Logic (BL), Data (DAL), and UI (PL) for maximum scalability.
